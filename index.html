                With a problem this big, extreme countermeasures are needed. In 2021, th
                e ILO, in partnership with the global alliance, declared the International
                 Year against Child Labour. Both with goals to completely end the problem
                  by 2025. In addition, there is currently only one day against this crime,
                   June 12

            What we can do starts with simple acts, like never buying anything from children, so we don't
            cycle to crime. And in addition, we must also report, dialing 100 or talking on the website of
           <a href="https://www.gov.br/trabalho-e-previdencia/pt-br">Work Ministery</a>. With simple attitudes we can make the world
            much better
